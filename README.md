# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

## Description

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game played to settle differences between two people. The game is taught to kids to resolve their own disputes without adult intervention. However, this game requires quick thinking and perceptive reasoning.

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an improved version of the standard game of chance "Rock Paper Scissors". It got popular when it was mentioned in the comedy 'The Big Bang Theory', but initially it was created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla.

> I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock-Paper-Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability.

## UX Design

### User stories

### Colour Theory

The colors used for this game were chosen according to how they are appreciated in various aspects of daily life. The color-coding in the game is familiar to us, and we already know their meanings, so the game can be pretty intuitive by the colors. The colors are gray, green, red, yellow, and white.

![Color Palette for the game]

The gray color is a diplomatic color, as it is between black and white, and will be used for the background of the site. On this way, the user can feel that it's in a neutral space facing his challenge.

The color green evokes powerful emotions, and it's a dominant color in nature that makes us think of growth. It is also associated with rest, security and progress. This color will highlight who is winning on each round.

The red color on nature is a warning sign, usually when something is red, it is poisonous or harmful in some way. This color will be used to highlight who is losing on each round.

The white color is bright and can create a sense of space or add highlights. This color can symbolize a new beginning or fresh start. This color will be used to highlight user's decision and for texts.

The yellow stimulates our nerves, glands and brains, makes us more alert and energetic, stimulates our memory and promotes communication. It is a color that promotes activity and interaction. For this reason, it is used for the rule button at the top of the page and to highlight a draw.

### Typography

For headings and important texts, Mclaren regular 400 is used because it is a readable font with a slightly playful look that complements the rest of the site.
And for paragraphs Open San Serif is used, it is a clear and simple font that does not distract the user. And it is readable for the most important text (rules).
